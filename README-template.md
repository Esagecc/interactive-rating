 ### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
seperating the items for both context box. 



```css
able to center the module for the mobile and desktop
```
```js
I learned to check the file to connected with index. 

```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I want to continue to use Javascript to help with the project. I want to understand it with more ease. 

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

After completeding the CSS and HTML, I logged in Slack with FEM to get guidance. The most effective way I learned was using the youtube video https://youtu.be/oZJb_GPAlc4.
